    "## Association Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Association analysis** is a data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, or correlations among a set of items in large datasets. It is commonly applied in market basket analysis to identify sets of products frequently purchased together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support** is a measure that indicates how frequently a particular item or item set appears in a dataset. It is defined as the proportion of transactions that contain the item or item set. In the context of association rules, support helps to determine the significance of an item set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence** is a measure of the reliability of an association rule. It is defined as the proportion of transactions containing the antecedent (the \"if\" part of the rule) that also contain the consequent (the \"then\" part of the rule). High confidence indicates a strong likelihood that the rule is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Apriori Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Apriori principle** states that if an item set is frequent (meets the minimum support threshold), then all of its subsets must also be frequent. This principle allows for the efficient identification of frequent item sets by pruning the search space, reducing the number of candidate item sets that need to be examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Candidate Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A **candidate set** is a collection of item sets that are being considered for frequent item set generation. The candidate set is generated based on previous frequent item sets, and it is evaluated against the minimum support threshold to determine which item sets are frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Min Support Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The **minimum support threshold** is a user-defined parameter that specifies the minimum frequency an item set must have to be considered frequent. It helps in filtering out infrequent item sets and reduces the computational burden of the association analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frequent Item Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A **frequent item set** is a set of items that appears in a dataset with a frequency equal to or greater than the minimum support threshold. Frequent item sets are the basis for generating association rules, which reveal relationships between items in the dataset.\n"
