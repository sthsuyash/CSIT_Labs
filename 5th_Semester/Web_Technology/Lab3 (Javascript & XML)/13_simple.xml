Each child element has text content providing information about the book.
This is a basic structure, and XML can be used to represent more complex data with nested elements and attributes. Remember that XML documents start with a declaration (<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>). The declaration specifies the XML version and the character encoding used in the document.
